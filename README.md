**Thesis Title**: Application of Generative Prediction to Build Digital Twin of Chemical Process Operation
**Author**: DA-JYUN NI (倪大鈞)
**Institution**: Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University
**Date**: June 2025

## Overview
This study primarily discusses the process of developing a digital twin for chemical processes using data-driven methods. Sequence-to-sequence models and Transformer models are employed, incorporating our proposed autoregressive training loss to construct the digital twin. The goal is for these models to possess generative forecasting capabilities.

- Conclusion:

**Autoregressive training significantly enhance the generative capabilities of StSML and Transformer models**
