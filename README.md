## ðŸ“„Overview
This study primarily discusses the process of developing a digital twin for chemical processes using data-driven methods. Sequence-to-sequence models(StS) and Transformer models are employed, incorporating our proposed autoregressive training loss(AT) to construct the digital twin. The goal is for these models to possess generative forecasting capabilities.

- Conclusion:

**Autoregressive training significantly enhance the generative capabilities of StSML and Transformer models**
